    Briefly summarize the DriverPass project. Who was the client? What type of system did they want you to design?
    DriverPass was the client. They were wanting a system to allow their customers to book driver training sessions, take practice tests, and receive updates on progress. The system also needs to allow authorized users to download reports, make changes to user accounts, and confirm appointments. 
    
    What did you do particularly well?
    I think one of the things that I did particularly well was understand the business calue that would be added to the client. This is a company that was looking to provide real value and grow their business.
    
    
    If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?
    If given the opportunity I would revise some of the charts that were made with more information. I think they were fine, but more detail could have helped communicate the intent a bit better.
    
    
    How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your system design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?
    I think considering user needs is one of the most (if not the most) important parts of system design. I really took the time to consider how users would interact with the system and what those interactions would mean for the system.
    
    
    How do you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a system?
    My approach usually centers around the following:
      What does the user need to be able to do?
      What does the user want to be able to do?
      What would make the user experience better?
      What technical requirements are needed to accomplish these goals?
   From there I would create use cases and diagrams to help get from where we are to where we need the system to be.
